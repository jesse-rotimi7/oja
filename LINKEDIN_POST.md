# LinkedIn Post - Oja E-commerce Project

🚀 Just completed building **Oja** - a full-stack e-commerce marketplace that showcases modern web development practices!

## What I Built

A feature-rich e-commerce platform with:
✅ Product browsing & search
✅ Shopping cart management (guest & authenticated users)
✅ Order processing system
✅ User favorites/wishlist
✅ Secure authentication system
✅ Product reviews
✅ Responsive design with dark mode
✅ Smooth animations & modern UI

## Tech Stack Deep Dive

**Frontend:**
• Next.js 15 with Turbopack ⚡ (latest features & blazing fast builds)
• React 19 (cutting-edge React features)
• TypeScript (type-safe development)
• Tailwind CSS 4 (modern utility-first styling)
• Framer Motion (smooth animations & transitions)
• Radix UI (accessible component primitives)
• TanStack Query (powerful data fetching & caching)
• Zustand (lightweight state management)

**Backend:**
• Next.js API Routes (serverless backend)
• PostgreSQL (robust relational database)
• Prisma ORM (type-safe database access)
• NextAuth.js v5 (authentication & session management)
• bcryptjs (secure password hashing)

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
🔐 Dual authentication support - both guest sessions and registered users
📦 Persistent cart system - cart data survives browser sessions
🎯 Type-safe end-to-end - from database to UI with TypeScript & Prisma
⚡ Optimized performance - React Query caching, image optimization, code splitting

## What I Learned

• Building scalable e-commerce architecture
• Implementing secure authentication flows
• Managing complex state with multiple data sources
• Creating smooth UX with modern animation libraries
• Type-safe database operations with Prisma
• Server-side rendering strategies with Next.js 15

The project demonstrates full-stack capabilities, modern React patterns, and production-ready code architecture.
